    "## Author Notes to Adopting Instructors\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson is meant to introduce students to the basic princples of performing symbolic algebraic manipulations in Python using the `algebra_with_sympy` wrapper for the larger `sympy` library. The Python and `algebra_with_sympy` skills that students learn in this lesson are themselves somewhat trivial, but are an absolutely necessary foundation if it is desired that they continue onward to use these libraries for performing symbolic calculus (covered in the separate lesson \"symbolic-calculus\" in this module). Below I have provided some implementation notes and suggestions for successful adoption, as well as some disclaimers for the transferrability of some of the software tools beyond the scope of these materials.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson is provided in three versions, with two intended teaching modalities:\n",
    "- `symbolic-algebra-instructor-key.ipynb`: Instructor \"key\" notebook with completed code cells and full instructor commentary in Markdown cells\n",
    "- `symbolic-algebra-instructor-notes.ipynb`: Author notes for adopting instructors, including implementation strategies, common issues & workarounds, piloting notes, etc.\n",
    "- `symbolic-algebra-async.ipynb`: Student notebook with full instructor commentary in Markdown cells, but with code cells redacted. Intended for students to be able to follow along with the written instructor commentary and complete code cells when prompted, either asynchronously outside the classroom or in class with passive instructor facilitation & support.\n",
    "- `symbolic-algebra-skeleton.ipynb`: Fully redacted notebook with only section headings and a few execute-only code cells retained. Intended for in-class \"live\" coding instruction, where the instructor discusses the Markdown commentary from the other lesson versions and contemporaneously narrates the completion of the code cells, while students actively complete code in their own skeleton notebooks at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Piloting Notes\n",
    "- I have piloted an earlier version of this lesson (formatted similarly to the `symbolic-algebra-async.ipynb` version) using a live coding modality, and students struggled to process both my oral discussion points and the written instructional commentary in Markdown cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disclaimers\n",
    "\n",
    "While the `algebra_with_sympy` wrapper library does clean up much of the `sympy` user interface, there are still several persistent issues that students commonly encounter --- as well as some specific to `algebra_with_sympy` --- that I briefly summarize below.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Challenges with `sympy`\n",
    "\n",
    "- Stack Overflow is likely a better resource than the official `sympy` & `algebra_with_sympy` docs\n",
    "    >The official documentation for `sympy` is very challenging to read. The library's intended purpose seems to be one of ultimate mathematical generalizability rather than intuitiveness of use, and was written _by_ professional mathematicians _for_ professional mathematicians. As a result, the level of theoretical mathematical rigor present in the documentation can make it inscrutable in places, particularly for undergrads who may be trying to troubleshoot their code.\n",
    "    >\n",
    "    >If a student is experiencing an unexpected `sympy` error that is not discussed below, and you as the instructor do not have formal mathematical training (beyond the typical required courses for an undergraduate degree in a physical science), I would strongly recommend searching for a relevant fix on Stack Overflow before turning to the official documentation.\n",
    "- Very specifically declare the scope of your math variables, lest you wait an hour for something \"simple\" to finish\n",
    "    > By default, every new variable in `sympy` is assumed to be complex-valued, making every new `Equation` also complex-valued. As a result, operations that _you_ think should be rapid and straightforward (e.g., using `solve()` or evaluating an odd integral over even bounds) might not seem so straightforward to `sympy`. The solution to this is to really clearly define the scope of your math variables at the time they are declared.\n",
    "    >\n",
    "    > For example, let's say we want to define an expression in `sympy` for a wavefunction over two spatial variables $\\left(x,\\ y\\right)$ that are both real numbers and two quantum numbers $n,\\ m$ which are both positive integers. Naively, we could just declare all four \"variables\" at once using\n",
    "    > ```python\n",
    "    > var('x y n m')\n",
    "    >```\n",
    "    > \n",
    "    > If we wished to normalize this wavefunction by integrating, `sympy` will assume by default that each of these variables are complex-valued, and the integral will likely become either incredibly complicated to perform or even impossible. Alternatively, we may declare these math variables along with their mathematical \"scope\" (what `sympy` calls [variable _assumptions_](https://docs.sympy.org/latest/guides/assumptions.html#the-old-assumptions-system)) like the following:\n",
    "    > ```python\n",
    "    >var('x y', real=True)\n",
    "    >var('n m', real=True, positive=True, integer=True)\n",
    "    > ```\n",
    "    >\n",
    "    > By doing so, any future operations performed by `sympy` on these variables (and the `Equation`s they define) will also be done consistent with the desired chemical context of the problem.\n",
    "- Ensure students re-define their math variables _every single time they change context_\n",
    "    > Because specifying the mathematical scope of a math variable is so critical for `sympy` to behave as \"expected,\" reusing a named variable (e.g., $x$ or $n$) in a context or problem beyond where it was originally intended can lead to a prolonged headache that has nothing to do with the student's math or coding _in the new problem_. For example, if a student is trying to solve two problems in the same notebook:\n",
    "    > - Problem 1: $m$ is a nonnegative real number representing mass\n",
    "    > - Problem 2: $m$ as a positive integer representing a quantum number\n",
    "    > \n",
    "    > The mathematical scopes of these two $m$'s are therefore fundametally incompatible. Unfortunately, because cells in a Jupyter notebook can be executed in any order, students may find themselves performing a `sympy` operation on what they _believe_ to be positive integer $m$ but which is _currently actually_ nonnegative real number $m$. A student in this situation will almost certainly see some unexpected (nominally incorrect) code behavior, _even if their actual code or symbolic math is correct_, just because they didn't realize their variable wasn't what they thought.\n",
    "    >\n",
    "    > In addition to being  incredibly frustrating for the student, these math-variable-scope-incompatibility bugs are in my experience almost impossible to find and correct --- so train the students to avoid them instead by just redeclaring their variables fresh for each new context.\n",
    "- Beware name clashes, particularly between math variables and Python variables\n",
    "    > A common strategy for solving chemical problems with `sympy` is to (a) define an equation which needs to be manipulated in some way (e.g., solving for a variable, differentiating with respect to something, etc.), (b) substitute numerical values into the new form of the equation, and (c) extract a final numerical answer.\n",
    "    >\n",
    "    > In the formic acid pH example worked through below, the quadratic equation constructed by the requisite ICE table involves both the weak acid equilibrium constant ($K_a$) and the formal concentration of formic acid ($F$). After defining math variables for $K_a$ and $F$ to construct their quadratic equation in `sympy`, students often wish to define Python variables storing their numerical values to facilitate their later substitution. When doing so, students must be careful to _not use the same names for both Python variable and math variable_, as this will cause the name to be overwritten and their code to break.\n",
    "    >\n",
    "    > My preferred strategy for avoiding this issue is for the math variable to have the \"correct\" name (e.g., `K_a`), and the Python variable storing its numerical value to have `_val` appended to the variable name (i.e., `K_a_val`). That way, both variable safety is maintained and the naming convention helps clue in the user about the contents & scope of each variable.\n",
