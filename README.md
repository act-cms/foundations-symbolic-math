# Foundations of Symbolic Mathematics in Python

While many chemical problems can be solved by a "longhand" pen-and-paper
approach, several advanced concepts rely on mathematical skills (e.g.,
calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, variational optimization,
etc.) with which not every student may feel comfortable. This module is meant
to help students develop foundational skills in performing symbolic
mathematical operations in Python. These modules are each structured with a few
applications to chemical problem solving at the general chemistry (first-year)
level, and provide any additional conceptual background when necessary.

Current Lessons:
- Symbolic Algebra

Planned Lessons (coming soon!):
- Symbolic Calculus
